# Diamond Ticket

A diamond ticket is created by decrypting a valid TGT, making changes to it and re-encrypt it using the AES keys of the krbtgt account which makes it less detectable. Diamond Ticket is more about repackaging than forging. Itâ€™s a lot more OpSec safe than Golden Ticket.

## Modify The Ticket
