## 0. Defenses&#x20;

### Policy language mode

Enumerate PS Language Mode - [#language-mode](basic-enumeration/protection.md#language-mode "mention")

if the Language is constrained:\
try to bypass using PS v2 or  [#list-applocker-rules](basic-enumeration/protection.md#list-applocker-rules "mention")

### Bypass AMSI&#x20;

Bypass AMSI every new PowerShell session -[#amsi-bypass](misc/bypass-defenses.md#amsi-bypass "mention")

Also [#invisi-shell](misc/bypass-defenses.md#invisi-shell "mention") can be used

### Bypass Defender

[#windows-defender](misc/bypass-defenses.md#windows-defender "mention")

### Firewall

[#firewall](misc/bypass-defenses.md#firewall "mention")

## 1. Local Privilege Escalation

check our privileges using `whoami /all`

Use [#powerup-1](privilege-escalation/local-privilege-escalation.md#powerup-1 "mention") and discover the vectors:

* Unquoted Service
* Modifiable Service File
* Modifiable Service

Once we are Local admin use [lsass-dump.md](lateral-movement/lsass-dump.md "mention") to find other users logons

## 2. Domain Enumeration

### ACL

[acl.md](ad-enumeration/acl.md "mention")

Better to write down the interesting ACL so they might be useful later

**BloodHound** is very useful visualizing ACLs

### General

[gnereral.md](ad-enumeration/gnereral.md "mention")

Start to build up a mind map for attacking paths

* Domain
* Domain Controller&#x20;
* Users
* Computers
* Domain and Enterprise Administrators
* OUs
* GPOs
* SPNs

### Forests and Trusts

Understand trusts and map them between the domains

[forests-and-trusts.md](ad-enumeration/forests-and-trusts.md "mention")

## 3. Domain Privileges Escalation

* &#x20;Reverse shell by abusing Jenkins
* [#user-hunting](ad-enumeration/gnereral.md#user-hunting "mention") - Hunt for local admin access
* [ad-cs.md](privilege-escalation/cross-domain-privilege-escalation/ad-cs.md "mention")&#x20;
* &#x20;[delegations.md](privilege-escalation/domain-privilege-escalation/delegations.md "mention") - Search for Delegations
* [acl.md](persistence/acl.md "mention") - abusing ACL can lead to RBCD, DC Sync and Reset user password
* [mssql-servers.md](privilege-escalation/cross-domain-privilege-escalation/mssql-servers.md "mention")&#x20;



## 4. Cross Domain Privilege Escalation

* [mssql-servers.md](privilege-escalation/cross-domain-privilege-escalation/mssql-servers.md "mention")&#x20;
* [trusts.md](privilege-escalation/cross-domain-privilege-escalation/trusts.md "mention") - After abusing Trust keys or krbtgt of trusted domain it is possible to abuse other forest abusing Inter-Realm TGT&#x20;
